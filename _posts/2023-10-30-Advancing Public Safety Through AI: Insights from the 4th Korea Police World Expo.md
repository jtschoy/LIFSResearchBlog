# Advancing Public Safety Through AI: Insights from the 4th Korea Police World Expo

&emsp; The Korea Police World Expo is the only conference in East Asia that focuses on public safety, security, cybercrime, and law enforcement. The expo provides a platform for police and security agencies, technology companies, and other stakeholders from around the world to showcase and communicate the latest technologies, equipment, and solutions related to policy and public safety. The Expo aims to enhance global collaboration in law enforcement, promote public safety innovations, and contribute to the development of safer communities. The event attracts participants from various countries, promoting international cooperation and networking opportunities. The exhibitions allow hands-on experience and demonstrations of new equipment and technologies.

&emsp; The 4th Korea Police World Expo was held at the Songdo Convensia in Incheon between October 18th to 21st of 2023. The Legal Informatics and Forensic Science (LIFS) institute at Hallym University has been serving as the lead research institution for the ‘Advanced Technology Development Project for Scientific Crime Investigation’ under the Korean National Police Agency since 2021. Their main goal is to utilize AI technology in terms of helping with crime investigation, categorized as ‘AI-based Crime Investigation Support’.

&emsp; For crime investigators, the time and resource costly areas are writing investigation reports and gathering information from large volumes of data. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly enhance crime investigation processes in various ways, providing law enforcement agencies with advanced tools to analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. Although a lot of programs still require human interaction in order to make sure the filtering and data sequencing was performed accurately, the ultimate goal is to allow the program itself to be able to pull out only the necessary information from the vast amount of data stored, without hallucinations and false sequencing. Although the project was initiated in 2021, the creation of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022 established a new possibility with the use of Natural Language Processing and fine-tuning towards a more human-like language model. This will accelerate the process of all the paperwork and is expected to save over 115 billion Korean won or 90 million dollars annually in crime investigation and increase the efficiency of crime investigation by upwards of 12.5%.

&emsp; In conclusion, the 4th Korea Police World Expo demonstrated the pivotal role that innovative technologies, particularly AI, can play in modernizing crime investigation and law enforcement. The involvement of the Legal Informatics and Forensic Science (LIFS) institute at Hallym University exemplifies the importance of academic and practical collaborations in advancing public safety measures. As AI tools like ChatGPT continue to evolve, they offer unprecedented opportunities to streamline investigative processes, reduce costs, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis. The Expo not only highlighted these technological advancements but also fostered international cooperation, providing a valuable platform for global stakeholders to exchange knowledge and best practices. Moving forward, the integration of AI in law enforcement holds the promise of significantly enhancing public safety and building safer communities worldwide.
