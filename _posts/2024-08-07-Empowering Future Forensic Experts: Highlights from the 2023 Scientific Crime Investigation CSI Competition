# Empowering Future Forensic Experts: Highlights from the 2023 Scientific Crime Investigation CSI Competition

On September 29, 2023, the President of Hallym University cooperated with Pyo-Chang Won Institute of Crime Science at the School of Global Studies to host the 2023 Scientific Crime Investigation CSI Competition. This competition was an expanded version of the CSI Competition that started in 2015. The Department of Convergent Forensic Science and Professor Pyo-Chang Won, a former profiler and specially appointed professor at Hallym University, collaborated to host the competition. The event is designed to provide high school students with opportunities and experience simulated crime scenes and forensic profiling, enhancing their understanding of forensic science and awareness about crime.

Professor Pyo-Chang Won and faculty members from the Department of Convergent Forensic Science conducted hands-on forensic and profiling experience. Participants collected and analyzed evidence from crime scenes and presented their data to determine the winning team. The judges included forensic examiners from Gangwon Provincial Police Agency and professors from the National Police University, involved in practical crime investigations. Students from Hallym University’s Global Convergence College assisted as staff, helping with the execution of the program.
	
Among the ten teams selected through intense competition from high school forensic science clubs nationwide, the Grand Prize was awarded to the I.S.B. team from Chuncheon Girls’ High School, the Excellence Award to Wickipedia team from Chadwick International School, and the Outstanding Award to the Science Expedition team from Hwajeong High School. Professor Pyo also stated that he aims to strengthen the Scientific Crime Investigation CSI Competition so that any student can participate in hands-on learning opportunities. 
	
In conclusion, the 2023 Scientific Crime Investigation CSI Competition successfully expanded its reach and impact, providing a unique platform for high school students to engage in practical forensic science. The collaboration between Hallym University, Professor Pyo-Chang Won of Crime Science, and esteemed law enforcement professionals offered an invaluable educational experience, blending academic knowledge with real-world applications. The enthusiasm and dedication shown by participants and organizers alike underscore the competition's potential to inspire the next generation of forensic experts. Looking ahead, the commitment to making this competition an accessible and enriching opportunity for all students promises to cultivate a deeper interest in forensic science and crime prevention.
