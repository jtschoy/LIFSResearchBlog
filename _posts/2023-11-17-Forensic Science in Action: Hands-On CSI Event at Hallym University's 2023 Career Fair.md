&emsp;Professor Han-Soo Kim, who led the experience, expressed his pleasure at the diverse interest students showed in the department. He remarked, "I am pleased to see the varied interest in our department. I hope this experience has provided students with a positive opportunity to consider double majoring and think about their career paths." A sophomore from the Department of Biomedical Science, who participated in the experience, shared positive feedback in an interview: "It was very satisfying to engage in the special experience of identifying bloodstains and pinpointing suspects and murder weapons through small clues in a mock crime scene. Majoring in Convergent Forensic Science would allow me to practice digital forensics and testify about analyzed evidence in mock trials, making it easier to apply my major knowledge in practical situations after graduation."
