The second, third, and fourth sessions respectively covered topics on tracking charter fraud, detecting fraudulent transactions in virtual assets, and supporting integrated decision-making for emergency services (112/119).

&emsp;Professor Ro-Seop Park shared his thoughts on the seminar, stating, "It was a meaningful opportunity to conduct R&D research on scientific policing using public safety data and to share the latest technologies and research trends in the field of data forensics. We aim for our society to become a platform for experts from various fields to communicate and share knowledge, thereby contributing to public safety and scientific policing."
